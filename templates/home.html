        The BCC Projects Dashboard is your one-stop shop for gaining comprehensive insights into the health and progress of our ongoing endeavors.  
        Here's a glimpse into the stories the various data points tell:
      </p>
      <h3>Contract Details</h3>
      <p class="sub_paragraph">
        The Contract Details section provides a comprehensive overview of the key details associated with each project,
        including the project name, contract number, contract amount, and contract status.
      </p>
      <h3>Management and Timeline</h3>
      <p class="sub_paragraph">
        Identify the project manager assigned to each contract and track key dates like contract signing (by both BCC and the contractor),
        early start and finish dates, and any extensions granted.
      </p>
      <h3>Financial Snapshot</h3>
      <p class="sub_paragraph">
        The dashboard empowers you to visualize the financial aspects of your projects. See the contract value, including the contingency buffer, alongside performance and advance payment guarantees and their expiry dates. 
        Track the total certified interim payments made so far to gauge project spending.
      </p>
      <h3>Progress Tracking</h3>
      <p class="sub_paragraph">
        Evaluate project advancement through both financial and physical progress percentages. 
        This dual perspective helps assess if expenditures are aligned with the physical completion stage.
      </p>
      <h3>Project Status</h3>
      <p class="sub_paragraph">
        Stay informed about the current status of each project (e.g., ongoing, completed, on hold). 
        This allows for quick identification of potential roadblocks and facilitates informed decision-making.
